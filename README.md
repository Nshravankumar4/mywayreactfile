Step 1: Set up the project
Start by creating a new ReactJS project using a tool like create-react-app. You will also need to install any necessary dependencies, such as axios for making API requests.

Step 2: Fetch data from the Disney API
Using Axios or any other library, fetch data from the Disney API. The API provides data about various Disney characters, movies, and other content. You can fetch data for at least 10 Disney characters or movies.

Step 3: Display data in a user-friendly way
Display the fetched data in a visually appealing way. You can use CSS or any UI library such as Bootstrap, Material-UI, or Semantic UI to style the application. Consider using cards to display data like name, image, URL, etc., about each Disney character or movie.

Step 4: Add sorting feature
Implement a sorting feature that allows the user to sort the characters by name or ID. You can use the Array.sort() method to sort the data.

Step 5: Add search feature (bonus points)
Implement a search feature that allows the user to search for specific characters or movies. You can use the Array.filter() method to filter the data based on the user's input.

Step 6: Test and deploy the application
Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Once you are satisfied with the application, deploy it to a hosting platform like Heroku, Netlify, or Firebase.

In summary, building a web application that fetches data from the Disney API and displays it in a user-friendly way requires setting up the project, fetching data from the API, displaying data in a visually appealing way, adding a sorting feature, and implementing a search feature (for bonus points).



Problem Statement:
The goal of this challenge is to create a simple web application that fetches data from the Disney API and displays it in a user-friendly way.

Requirements:
The application should be built using ReactJS. You can also use any CSS or UI Library if you want
The application should fetch data from the Disney API  This API provides data about various Disney characters. API: https://disneyapi.dev/
The fetched data should be displayed in a user-friendly way. and The user should be able to interact with the fetched data (e.g. filtering, sorting, etc.).

User Interface
The user interface is up to you, but it should be easy to use and visually appealing. You might consider using cards to display data (like name, image, url, etc) about each Disney character or movie. At a minimum, you should display information about at least 10 Disney characters or movies. You should also include a sorting feature that allows the user to sort the characters by name or id.

Bonus Points
Implement a search feature that allows the user to search for specific characters or movies. Use CSS to make the application look polished and professional.
